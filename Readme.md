<p>Soon as we recieved the assignment I went through to pinterest and looking up other portfolios for inspiriation thinking about what is possibly for me to achieve and what actually fits my design style. I’m quite minimalist when it comes to design, enjoying websites that are easy and pleasurable for the user. Here is my pinterest board: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com.au/macawmagic/portfolio/">https://www.pinterest.com.au/macawmagic/portfolio/</a> showcasing some websites I  admired.</p>

<p>After this, I went onto adobe Xd to design a rough wireframe.</p>

<p>I followed this wireframe with setting up my trello board, trello helps keep me on track with what I’m up to.<br>

Following work to do was find a color scheme and fonts to use for the website, I used <a href="http://khroma.co/">http://khroma.co/</a> to generate a color scheme based off colors I selected.</p>

<p>What an amazing site,  many potentional schemes for the future. Then off to google fonts, saving the links of fonts. As I started building my site, I noticed my logo just wasn’t fitting and went back to canva to design a new more suited logo for my page.</p>

<h4 id="describe-key-events-in-the-development-of-the-internet-from-the-1980s-to-today">Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today?</h4>
<p>First form of internet was called ARPANET which was an experimental military network. 	<br>
ARPANET started to get international nodes to connect to. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn develop<br>
a technique called TCP, allowing networks to understand each other.<br>
1993: Marc Andreessen and colleagues at University of Illinois create Mosaic, the first Web<br>
browser to combine graphics and text on a single page, opening the Web to the world with<br>
software that is easy to use.</p>

<p>All computers that connect to the internet have a IP address which separates them from other<br>
computers. IPs are completed unique characters.<br>
Domain Name Servers (DNS) are basically address books. When you type a web address in<br>
your browser, it will look at the DNS to find the website’s actual address. The browser needs to<br>
find out which server the website lives on.</p>

<p>Mobile networks, what this has done for our society today is insane. Immediate access to any information you want anywhere? How crazy. With an alive phone and reception it’s almost impossible to be truly lost, bored, or not be in contact with people. 30/40 years ago you tell anyone they would have access to anything basically anywhere you would of been called a mad man. This contributes to society in such a large manner that people can’t truly appreciate it, this has changed our work and social life completely.</p>
